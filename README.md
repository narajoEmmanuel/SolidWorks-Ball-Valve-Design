# Ball Valve Assembly in SolidWorks

This repository contains the SolidWorks model, drawings, and assembly files for a ball valve. 

The ball valve is a mechanical assembly designed for fluid flow regulation, consisting of 13 parts modeled and assembled in SolidWorks.

## Overview

Here is a brief explanation of the function of each part:

1. **Body:** The body contains the essential components and provides support to withstand pressure. It is threaded to the fitting, which connects the valve to the pipeline.

2. **Fitting (Racor):** This component facilitates the connection between the pipeline and the valve, using threading for secure attachment.

3. **Handle (Mango):** The rigid handle is designed for easy manipulation, serving as the actuator for valve operation.

4. **Screw and Nut:** The handle is connected to the spindle through a screw and nut mechanism. Two rubber O-rings ensure a tight seal between the handle and the body.

5. **Spindle (Husillo):** The spindle is responsible for rotating the ball, controlling the flow of liquid through the valve.

6. **Ball (Bola):** The ball, with a perforation, regulates water flow by contacting two ring-shaped ball seats made of Teflon. These seats serve as double seals to prevent leaks.

7. **Ball Seats (Asientos de Bola):** These ring-shaped seats made of soft Teflon provide a tight seal and ensure the valve's leak-free operation.

8. **Sleeve (Manguito):** Positioned between a ball seat and the closure, the threaded sleeve maintains the desired position of the ball and seats, exerting sufficient pressure for consistent sealing.

9. **O-ring:** A rubber O-ring, similar to those on the spindle, provides an additional seal between the sleeve and the body.

10. **Closure (Cierre):** The closure, acting as a rotatable nut, allows easy disconnection of the valve without breaking it, providing mobility and freedom to join and separate connections and valves.

## How to Use

Feel free to explore the SolidWorks files to understand the 3D model, assembly, and detailed drawings of each part. The assembly demonstrates the interaction between different components for proper valve functioning.
